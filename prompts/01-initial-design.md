# Prompt
“Design and implement a Spring Boot CRM API for Parks & Rec with create/get/list/delete, auditing, and a mocked insight endpoint.”

# Why
To quickly scaffold a clean architecture (entity, DTO, mapper, controller, service) and ensure testability and clarity before coding.

# Outcome
Matched intent — produced a complete API layout, endpoints, and data model.  
I refined the Customer fields and added soft-delete and auditing for realistic enterprise behavior.

# Model
